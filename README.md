# BEM_2D â€” Boundary Element Method for Earthquake Cycle Simulations

**BEM_2D** is a Python-based research code that models the **earthquake cycle** using the **Boundary Element Method (BEM)** with **rate-and-state friction laws**.  
The solver supports planar fault geometries and spring-slider analog systems, providing a fast and flexible framework for exploring fault mechanics, nucleation, and stress interactions across seismic cycles.

## Overview

The **Boundary Element Method (BEM)** is widely used in computational seismology for modeling quasi-dynamic fault slip.  
BEM_2D implements 2D elastostatic boundary integral equations with rate-and-state frictional constitutive laws, allowing users to explore:

- Nucleation of seismic events  
- Quasi-static and dynamic slip evolution  
- Earthquake recurrence intervals  
- Stress transfer and afterslip  
- Simplified spring-slider analogs

The code is fully written in **Python**, with performance-critical kernels accelerated using **Numba** for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
